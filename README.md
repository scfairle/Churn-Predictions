# Customer Churn Prediction with Random Forest

This project builds a machine learning model to predict customer churn using contract type, tenure, and monthly charges.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Identify customers likely to cancel service so the business can take proactive retention measures.

---

## 📊 Features Used

- Contract Type (Month-to-month, One year, Two year)
- Tenure (Months)
- Monthly Charges

---

## ✅ Model & Evaluation

- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Preprocessing**: One-hot encoding for contract type
- **Accuracy**: 100% on a small test sample (for demonstration purposes)

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations

- Customers with **short tenure and high charges** are most at risk.
- Offer **discounted bundles** or incentives for customers on **month-to-month plans** to increase retention.
